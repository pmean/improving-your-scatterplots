### Exercise, change the location

+ Use the Saratoga housing data set.
+ Revise the plot so that the location of the points represents X=Bedrooms and Y=Price.

<div class="notes">

Go back to the plot you just drew. Modify it so that the x location is Bedrooms and not Age.

</div>

### Exercise, Python code
+ Here's the Python code.
```
ch = alt.Chart(df).mark_point().encode(
    x='Bedrooms',
    y='Price'
)
```

<div class="notes">

You specify the x and y locations inside the encode function.

</div>

### Exercise, Python output

![Python scatterplot of bedrooms and price](../images/python/altair-basic-exercise-location.png)

<div class="notes">

This is what the Python graph should look like. There is a general upward trend. Houses with more bedrooms tend to cost more.

</div>

### Exercise, R code
+ Here's the R code
```
ggplot(
  saratoga_houses, 
  aes(x=Bedrooms, y=Price)) + 
  geom_point())
```

<div class="notes">

In R, the X and Y locations go inside the aes function. Normally the aes function sits insider the ggplot function.

</div>

### Exercise, R output

```{r bedrooms-and-price}
load("../../common-files/data/houses.RData")
initiate_image()
ggplot(saratoga_houses, aes(x=Bedrooms, y=Price)) + 
  geom_point()
finalize_image("Scatterplot of bedrooms and price")
```

`r display_image`

<div class="notes">

This is the plot in R. It shows a general upward trend.

</div>

### Exercise, Tableau steps
+ (Take your existing scatterplot of age and price)
+ Click on the Age pill
  + Choose the remove option
+ Drag Bedrooms to the Columns field
  + Change to Dimension, Continuus
  
<div class="notes">

In Tableau, click on Age in the Columns field and choose the remove option. The graph looks a bit weird with no columns, but ignore it. Drag Bedrooms over to the Columns field. Tableau wants to use a sum, but you want individual data points. So click on SUM(Bedrooms) and change it to a Dimension.

</div>

### Exercise, Tableau output

![Tableau scatterplot of Bedrooms and Price](../images/tableau/bedrooms-vs-price.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the Tableau output.

</div>
