### Exercise, Mortality by gender
+ Draw a bar chart showing counts involving both mortality and gender. Use normalized bars.

<div class="notes">

Mortality on the Titanic reflects the fact that this was an era when people really did believe in the concept of "women and children first." Someone like me, I'd be shoving the little kids aside so I could get on one of the lifeboats.

Anyway, examine how mortality is related to gender. It's a spoiler alert, but on the Titanic, Kate survives, but Leonardo, I am so sad to say this, didn't make it.

### Exercise,Python code
+ Python code
```
ch = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='sex',
    y=alt.Y('count()', stack='normalize'),
    color='survived'
)
```
+ Alternative
```
ch = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='survived',
    y=alt.Y('count()', stack='normalize'),
    color='sex'
)
```

<div class="notes">

Here is the Python code. Notice that there are two different approaches.

</div>

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
df = pd.read_csv("../../common-files/data/titanic3.csv")
ch = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='sex',
    y=alt.Y('count()', stack='normalize'),
    color='survived'
)
ch.save("../images/python/mortality-by-sex.html")
ch = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x='survived',
    y=alt.Y('count()', stack='normalize'),
    color='sex'
)
ch.save("../images/python/sex-by-mortality.html")
```

This is what the Python normalized barchart looks like.

### Exercise, R code
+ R code
```
ggplot(titanic, aes(x=survived, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(position="normalize")
```
+ Alternate version
```
ggplot(titanic, aes(x=sex, fill=survived)) +
  geom_bar(position="normalize")
```

### Exercise, R output, Mortality by sex

```{r mortality-by-sex}
initiate_image()
ggplot(titanic, aes(x=survived, fill=sex)) +
